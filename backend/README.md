# Tekashi Roll API
**Api from Tekashi Roll App**

_I still working on the api_

<!-- ## Routes

### Route -->
<!-- * **Method**
    * "Endpoint" -->

## Developer 
You need to have `Node.js` installed and have terminal access to follow next steps:

* **Install dependecies**
```
    npm install
```
* **Run locally (PORT 3000)**
```
    npm run dev
```
### Linter
The project uses `standard-with-typescript` linter in order to get the code cleaner, you can use it with keyboard shortcuts or runing the "lint" script:
```
    npm run lint
```
### Testing
You can run all unit test using "test" command:

* **Run all tests**
```
    npm run test
    or
    npm run test:watch
```
Or also use test:{name of test} to run just one test:
* **Run just one test**
```
    npm run test:register
```
_You can find more test scripts in the package.json file_

### Production
You can build the app using build script:
```
    npm run build
```
_This script compile code from Typescript to Javascript_

Also you can use start script in order to build and run the code: 
```
    npm run start
``` 
_This script compiles the code (using the same command as 'build') and runs the compiled code_

**For production you need to use _npm run start_**
